3. (Optional) Give it a custom title
4. Click **"Add Feed"**

### 2. Refresh Feeds

After adding feeds, click:
- **"Refresh All"** button to fetch articles from all feeds
- Or click the **‚Üª** button on individual feeds

### 3. Switch Views

Use the view toggle buttons in the header:
- **‚ò∞ List**: Traditional list view (all articles in one list)
- **‚äû Grid**: Netvibes-style widget view (each feed in its own colored box)

## Features to Explore

### Reading Articles

**List View:**
- Click any article to open it in an embedded viewer
- Click **"‚Üê Back to List"** to return
- Click the **‚óã** or **‚úì** button to toggle read/unread status

**Grid View:**
- Each feed shows in a colored widget
- See the last 10 items from each feed
- Unread count badge appears on widgets with unread items

### Filtering Options

**Filter by Read Status:**
- Toggle **"‚óã All Items"** / **"‚óè Unread Only"**

**Filter by Feed:**
- Click the feed dropdown (shows "All Feeds" or "X Selected")
- Check/uncheck specific feeds to filter

**Mark All as Read:**
- Click **"‚úì Mark All Read"** to mark all visible items as read

### Feed Management

**In the Feed Manager:**
- **Color Square**: Click to change feed color
- **‚úì/‚úó Toggle**: Activate/deactivate feeds
- **‚Üª Refresh**: Update this specific feed
- **‚úï Remove**: Delete the feed and all its articles

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Start with 3-5 feeds** to see how it works
2. **Use different colors** for different categories of feeds
3. **Deactivate feeds** instead of deleting them if you want to keep the articles
4. **Grid view is great** for quick scanning of multiple feeds
5. **List view is better** for focused reading of all new items

## Troubleshooting

### Feed won't load?
- Check if the URL is a valid RSS/Atom feed
- Some feeds may be blocked by CORS policies
- Try refreshing the feed again

### No articles showing?
- Make sure you've clicked "Refresh All" or refreshed individual feeds
- Check that feeds are activated (green ‚úì)
- Verify filters aren't hiding items

### Application not saving data?
- Data is stored in browser localStorage
- Don't use incognito/private mode
- Clearing browser data will delete your feeds

## Data Storage

All your data is stored locally in your browser:
- No account needed
- No data sent to any server (except when fetching RSS feeds)
- Data persists between sessions
- To clear all data: Open browser console and run `localStorage.clear()`

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Currently none implemented (potential future enhancement)

## SOLID Principles Implementation

This application follows SOLID principles:
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each service has one clear purpose
- **O**pen/Closed: Services can be extended without modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Interfaces are properly abstracted
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, focused interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Services depend on abstractions, not concretions
